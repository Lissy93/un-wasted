# UN-Wasted!
### *Your Bite on the Block*

> An app which helps minimise food waste, by providing a platform to which you can offer up 
in-date, good-to-eat food to others. Food items are stored on a decentralised ledger, and 
tokens and social rep encourages users to reduce waste when they've bought too much food.
This decentralised application uses smart-contracts to verify transactions, using 
[Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/).
